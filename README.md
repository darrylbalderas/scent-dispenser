# Scent-Dispenser
This project was assigned to a group of manufacturing engineering 
students by NASA. These students created a scent dispenser system that dispensed 5 scents using
inductor coils, valves, dc motors(pumps), plastic tubes, keypad, LCD screen, and test tubes. My contribution to this 
project was to develop the software that controlled the physical parts of this system. 
I created c++ libraries that controlled the inductor coils, valves, and pumps. This system has 5 test tubes, 6 inductor coils, 6 pumps, and 12 valves. Arduino Libraries for LCD screen and the keypad were already created, therefore, I simply integrated them through the Arduino IDE.
